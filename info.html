                Growing up, I had a strong interest in reading and writing. 
                I started off mostly writing prose at around the age of 13, and then later progressed to poetry.
                Iroinically, around that age, I did not have much interest in reading poetry,
                but as I continued to write, I began to consume it. 
                Today, my poems are inspired by many artists styles.
